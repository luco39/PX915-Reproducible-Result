    interface-specific block (e.g. 'mace_foundation = ...\\nmace_size = ...\\n'
    or 'uma_model = ...\\n'), built by the calling wrapper.

    Structures: pass either (start_xyz and end_xyz) to interpolate a path, or
    starttraj to start NEB directly from an existing multi-frame xyz path
    (e.g. one of the reaction trajectories under labelled_data/ -- goeneb
    only reads the atom label + first three numeric columns per line, so
    extra columns like forces are ignored and don't need stripping first).
    Exactly one of the two must be given. When starttraj is given,
    n_images/interp_mode are not used -- goeneb runs NEB on exactly however
    many frames the file contains.

    sidpp: if True, use Sequential IDPP (Sharada/Zhang et al.,
    https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c01111) to build the initial path
    instead of interp_mode + plain IDPP -- goeneb's path_interpolator_module
    branches on this before ever looking at interp_mode or IDPP, so those
    settings are simply ignored when sidpp=True. Only meaningful when
    generating a path from start_xyz/end_xyz; has no effect with starttraj,
    since there's no path to (re-)generate in that case.

    idpp: whether to run a plain IDPP pre-optimization pass on the initial
    path. IDPP is a purely geometric, pairwise-distance-based smoothing step
    -- it knows nothing about the real (MACE/UMA/QM) energy surface. This
    matters because goeneb applies it in *both* cases: after a naive
    interpolation from start_xyz/end_xyz (where it's genuinely useful, to
    spread out a straight-line interpolation into reasonable geometries),
    and -- easy to miss -- after reading in a starttraj (goeneb's
    produce_starting_path() runs it unconditionally if settings.IDPP is
    True, regardless of path source). Since a starttraj is usually already a
    sensible/relaxed path (e.g. a previous NEB run's finaltraj.xyz, or a
    real reaction trajectory), re-running a geometry-only IDPP pass on it
    can distort it significantly with no relation to the actual energy
    landscape -- if you restart a run from finaltraj.xyz and the reported
    barrier jumps to something wildly different on iteration 1, this is the
    most likely cause. Default (idpp=None) is smart: False when starttraj is
    given, True when interpolating from start_xyz/end_xyz (goeneb's own
    default). Pass explicitly to override either way.

    step_pred_method: which optimizer predicts each image's step from its
    NEB gradient. 'amgd' (default, adaptive momentum gradient descent) is
    goeneb's usual choice and generally robust, but its momentum term can
    overshoot and oscillate around a sharp/narrow barrier top or a slightly
    noisy PES (as MLIP surfaces like MACE/UMA can be) -- exactly the
    "reached maxiter but the climbing image never settled" failure mode.
    Other options (case-insensitive, see step_pred_module.py):
    'sd' (plain steepest descent, slower but non-oscillatory -- no momentum
    term to overshoot with), 'nr'/'rfo' (global Newton-Raphson / rational
    function optimization once a Hessian estimate is built up, after
    BFGS_start/NR_start iterations of AMGD warm-up), 'l-nr'/'l-rfo' (same
    but per-image local Hessians instead of one global one), 'sct'
    (self-consistent-tangent harmonic NEB). See
    plot_convergence_diagnostics() to check whether a given choice is
    actually settling down or still oscillating.

    max_step: the maximum allowed norm of any single image's step per
    iteration (goeneb's own default is 0.05); steps longer than this get
    rescaled down to this length (see enforce_maxstep() in
    step_pred_module.py) rather than rejected outright. Lowering this is a
    direct, blunt way to damp oscillation -- smaller steps can't overshoot
    as far -- at the cost of needing more iterations to get anywhere.

    stepsize_fac: scales the raw step every predictor takes (goeneb's own
    default 0.2) -- for 'sd' it's the entire step size (step = -stepsize_fac
    * gradient, no momentum, so this is the only lever controlling how fast
    it moves); for 'amgd' it scales the gradient term each iteration
    (on top of whatever momentum carries over); for the BFGS-family methods
    ('nr'/'rfo'/'l-nr'/'l-rfo'/'sct') it scales both the AMGD warm-up phase
    and the eventual Newton/RFO step. Raising it speeds up a slow-but-stable
    run (e.g. 'sd', which has no momentum to run away with even at a larger
    stepsize_fac); lowering it is another way to damp instability, similar
    in spirit to lowering max_step but scaling the predicted step itself
    rather than clipping an oversized one after the fact.

    The following six control the tangent/spring-force machinery that
    actually keeps the climbing image on the intended path and everything
    else roughly evenly spaced -- relevant if CI keeps landing somewhere you
    don't think is the real TS, since a poorly-behaved spring/tangent setup
    can let CI drift off the ridge you want it to climb, or let neighboring
    images bunch up/spread out in a way that distorts the tangent CI relies
    on:

    spring_gradient: how the spring force between adjacent images is
    computed (case-insensitive). 'difference' (default) is Henkelman &
    Jonsson's improved definition; 'projected' is the original NEB
    formulation; 'raw' is the un-projected spring force (not projected onto
    the tangent direction) -- rarely what you want, but available. If CI is
    drifting off-path, 'difference' vs 'projected' is one of the first
    things worth comparing, since it changes how strongly/where the path is
    held taut around the climbing image.

    k_const: the spring force constant, in Eh/Angstrom^2 (default 0.003).
    Larger values hold images more rigidly evenly-spaced (stronger
    resistance to bunching near a sharp feature like a TS) but can also
    fight harder against the real energy gradient's attempt to move an
    image toward where it actually wants to go; smaller values let images
    space themselves more freely along the energy landscape at the cost of
    weaker path-taughtness. If use_vark is True, this is instead the
    *maximum* spring constant used.

    use_vark: whether to use Henkelman & Jonsson's variable-k scheme, which
    scales each inter-image spring constant based on local energy (stiffer
    springs near the high-energy/TS region, softer ones near the low-energy
    ends) rather than one fixed k_const everywhere. Often more physically
    sensible for asymmetric barriers, and can help CI "lock on" to a sharp
    feature without the rest of the path being over/under-constrained.

    vark_min_fac: only used when use_vark=True -- the minimum spring
    constant between images is vark_min_fac * k_const (default 0.1, i.e.
    the softest springs are 10% of the max/k_const value).

    use_analytical_springpos: whether to use the analytical spring
    positioning scheme, which computes each image's ideal 1D position along
    the path directly rather than letting spring forces push it there
    iteratively. Does NOT work with the 'sct' step predictor. Can help
    images settle into evenly-spaced positions faster/more predictably, but
    is a more rigid scheme than the default force-based spacing.

    tangents: how the local tangent direction at each image is estimated
    (case-insensitive). 'henkjon' (default) is Henkelman & Jonsson's
    improved, energy-weighted tangent estimate (more robust near a sharp
    kink like a real barrier top); 'simple' is the older bisection-based
    tangent. Since climbing image's whole mechanism depends on correctly
    identifying "uphill along the tangent, downhill/spring-balanced
    everything else", a poor tangent estimate right where the path is
    sharply curved (exactly where a real TS tends to be) is a very plausible
    reason CI could get pushed somewhere other than where you expect --
    'henkjon' should generally be preferred, but worth trying 'simple' as a
    comparison point if you suspect the tangent estimate itself is the
    problem."""
